Welcome to yet-another-website that divulges Cloud Computing. _"Really? Wasn't that a thing back like 10 years ago? You guys are late"_ Of course we aren't. Since its inception, Cloud Computing has gained many adepts, and it is now essential for the success of many companies of all different sizes and shapes, from solo startup owners to big corporations.

Cloud Computing is the new electricity. Or the new oil. Its intrinsic properties disrupted the market, like pay-as-you-go for the infrastructure you need.  As more and more companies adventure their transitioning from old traditional on-premises data centres to the cloud, the more necessary it is to divulge and teach about it. Though many companies successfully migrated their workloads to the cloud, many others are struggling to catch up or find trustworthy, well-thought-out materials.

But Cloudverse is not about telling companies how they should approach the cloud, that's what consulting companies do. Cloudverse is a place to have conversations about everything that's going on in the Cloud Computing Universe. Initially, we start with a blog and a podcast with no other ambitions than teaching and divulging knowledge to anyone who wants to join us. And, of course, to learn back from all of you.
